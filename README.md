Weather predictionÂ¶

This is my first time trying to apply an ML Algorithm. I have some previous experience in R with Regressions.

Today I will tackle the weather prediction dataset which aims to predict a categorical value (weather condition) based on some numerical values given by attributes such as precipitation, temperatures and wind.
This problem is gonna be solved with a Decision Tree Classifier.
